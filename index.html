            <p>
                Hi there, I'm <b>Nynke</b>! I'm the local nerdy transgirl. I am
                currently in the graduation year of my bachelor's degree in
                electrical engineering. During my study I gained an interest in
                programming and automation, and I also found my passion for
                computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a Linux fanatic, I decided to make the switch when copilot
                was first installed on my Windows 11 PC. I was already familiar
                with the operating system as I use it to run my home server. I
                tried various distros, and eventually settled on Arch Linux.
