            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hi there! I'm <b>Nynke</b>, your local nerdy trans girl and
                soon-to-be electrical engineer. Currently I'm in the final year
                of my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, where I
                discovered my love for programming, automation, and all things
                related to computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Somewhere along the way, I also became a Linux fanatic. I made
                the full switch after Copilot first appeared on my Windows 11
                machine. Since I was already using Linux to run my home server,
                the transition was smooth. I distro-hopped for a couple months,
                but I eventually settled on Arch Linux, and I haven’t looked
                back since.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m passionate about self-hosting and open-source software. Some
                of my favorite applications are Jellyfin, Nextcloud, Wordpress,
                Wireguard, and Home Assistant. Applications that I use every day
                and can no longer imagine going without.
            </p>
